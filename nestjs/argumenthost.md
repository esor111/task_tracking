you can make different type of a application http based microservice based websocket based
http=>contextype=> http
microservice=>contextype=> rpc=> remote produral call
websocketcontextype=> ws

by arument host we know what type of context type application based on that we can write the logic
we have lots of method in argument host suppost getTYpe=> by using getType we can know what type of  application http or rpc or ,,,,

for http we have have  switchtohttp()=>by using http ko regarding jati propeties , operations , all the avilable tecnics we can get from this i can i get all the information 

httpbased argument host

getRequest()
getResponse()
getNext()

getRequest(): This method returns the HTTP request object associated with the current execution context. It provides access to details such as request headers, query parameters, request body, and other information related to the incoming request.

getResponse(): This method returns the HTTP response object associated with the current execution context. It allows you to modify the response by setting headers, status codes, and sending a custom response body.

getNext(): This method returns the next function in the interceptor chain. It allows you to proceed to the next interceptor or the final request handler.
In NestJS, interceptors are executed in a chain-like fashion. When an HTTP request is received, it passes through a series of interceptors before reaching the final request handler (controller method or route handler). Each interceptor in the chain can modify the request or response and perform additional actions.
The getNext() method is used within an interceptor to proceed to the next interceptor or the final request handler in the chain. It returns a function that allows the interceptor to pass control to the next entity in the chain.
Imagine you're in a line to get ice cream. There are multiple people in front of you, and each person has a different flavor choice. Each person represents an interceptor in NestJS.

Now, when it's your turn, you have two options:

You can take your ice cream and leave without interacting with anyone else. This represents the final request handler or controller method in NestJS. It's the last stop in the line where the actual response is generated.

You can choose to pass the ice cream to the next person in line. This represents the getNext() method in NestJS. It allows you to hand over control to the next interceptor in the line.

So, in the context of NestJS interceptors, the getNext() method gives you the ability to pass control to the next interceptor in the chain. It's like passing the ice cream to the next person in line.

By doing this, each interceptor gets a chance to do something with the request or response before passing it along to the next interceptor or the final request handler. It ensures that each interceptor in the chain gets an opportunity to process the request and modify it if needed.

Once the request has passed through all the interceptors (all the people in line), it reaches the final request handler, where the actual response is generated. Then, the response travels back through the interceptors, allowing them to modify it if necessary, before finally being returned to the client.
