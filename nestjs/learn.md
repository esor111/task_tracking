LOGIN
User initiates login: The user enters their email and password in the login form on the client-side (frontend) application.

Client-side validation: The client-side application may perform basic validation, such as checking for empty fields or valid email format. However, the actual validation and authentication should be performed on the server-side to ensure security.

Sending login request to the server: The client-side application sends a login request to the server (backend) to process the login attempt. This request contains the user's email and password.

Server-side validation and authentication:

The server checks if the provided email exists in the database.
If the email exists, the server retrieves the user's hashed password from the database.
The server uses a hashing algorithm to hash the provided password (sent by the client) and then compares it with the stored hashed password from the database.
If the passwords match, it means the user has entered the correct password, and authentication is successful. Otherwise, the login attempt fails.
Generating an authentication token: If the login is successful, the server generates an authentication token (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Token) that contains information about the user's identity and expiration time.

Sending the authentication token to the client: The server sends the generated authentication token back to the client as a response to the login request.

Client-side handling of the authentication token: The client-side application receives the authentication token and stores it securely, usually in local storage, session storage, or cookies.

Authorization and protected routes: Once the client-side application has the authentication token, it can use it to access protected routes or perform authorized actions on the server. The client includes the authentication token in the headers of subsequent API requests to prove its identity and permissions.

It's important to note that the process may vary depending on the specific technologies and frameworks used in your application. The architecture and implementation may differ based on factors such as the backend framework (e.g., Nest.js), the database (e.g., PostgreSQL), the authentication/authorization library, and any additional security measures you have in place.

Overall, the main goal of this process is to securely validate the user's identity and grant access to authorized resources based on their provided credentials. Additionally, using hashed passwords and tokens helps protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
